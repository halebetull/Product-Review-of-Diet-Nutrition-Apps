# Diet & Nutrition Apps – Product Analysis Case

This project is a small, product-focused analysis of diet and nutrition applications.
The goal is to understand where users struggle, what supports engagement, and how
product decisions translate into real user experience.

## Scope

The study compares **Diyetkolik**, **Yazio**, and **FatSecret**.
The analysis focuses on:
- Onboarding experience
- How quickly users are guided into action
- Clarity of settings and personalization options
- Perceived support
- Overall ease of use

Insights are based on in-app observations and recurring patterns found in app store reviews.

## Guerrilla Testing

To support the analysis, a small-scale guerrilla test was conducted with **two participants**.
Participants were given identical tasks across all three applications.
Task completion times were measured and friction points were observed.

The results were compared to evaluate which product enabled faster task completion
with lower cognitive effort.

## Notes

This is not a full UX research study or a detailed user flow analysis.
It is a small case aimed at understanding how high-level product decisions
reflect on everyday user behavior from a **product management perspective**.
